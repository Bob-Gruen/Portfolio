It is a picture taken from the manufacturing floor at Cold Jet.  It shows a shipping/receiving dashboard I built for them.  Details again are, a 55" LG Digital Signage Display with an AppSpace ChromeOS based digital signage system.
 
The picture was taken from about 10' away and the bottom of the dashboard is ~8' off of the ground.
